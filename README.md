Summer project with Rick
===========================

So far everything is very basic, I should perhaps separate my helper
classes and functions into a separate library to keep the code cleaner.

If you want to try something out you need access to the data files,
so email me and I'll try to fix that.

TODOs:
 * Update the lepton code to use the much more reasonable new build system instead of ACLIC
 * Come up with some neat system to store number of passes/cuts so that I can run several sets at once
