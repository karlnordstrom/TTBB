Summer project with Rick
===========================

If you want to try something out you need access to the data files,
so email me and I'll try to fix that.

TODOs:
 * Update the lepton code to use the much more reasonable new build system instead of ACLIC  -- DONE
 * Come up with some neat system to store number of passes/cuts so that I can run several sets at once -- DONE
 * Clean up the library by dividing into smaller constituents and only combining when linking -- DONE
 * Improve histogramming (probably by writing helper class?)
